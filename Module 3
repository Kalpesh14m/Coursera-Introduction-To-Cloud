Question 1)
Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (also known as Availability Zones). What are Zones ?
==>
Unique physical locations with one or more data centers 

Question 2)
Is it possible to run completely different operating systems on Virtual Machines (VMs) that are on a single host? If yes, what makes this possible ?
==>
Yes, Virtualization makes it possibleâ€” to have VMs, running different operating systems, on a single host. 

Question 3)
Which of the following are examples of single-tenant compute environments in the Cloud? Select two.
==>
Dedicated host 
Bare Metal servers

Question 4)
Which of these scenarios is ideal for the use of bare metal servers, as opposed to virtual servers ? Select two.
==>
CPU and I/O intensive workloads
Huge performance and strict security and compliance requirements 

Question 5)
What are some key differences between Containers and Virtual Machines ? Select two.
==>
Containers can use the same OS as the host, while a virtual machine needs its own copy of the OS, which can also be different from the host OS 
Containers are more lightweight as compared to virtual machines 

Question 6)
There are four types of cloud storage available. Which storage type is ephemeral or non-persistent ?
==>
Direct Attached storage

Question 7
What makes File storage an ideal solution for scenarios where shared storage is needed ?
==>
File storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes at the same time 

Question 8)
Which of these scenarios are best suited for Block Storage ? Select two.
==>
Workloads that need low-latency storage
Applications that need consistent fast access to disk, such as databases 

Question 9)
Which of these are features of Object Storage ? Select two.
==>
Object storage is effectively infinite 
You can directly use Object Storage without attaching it to a compute node

Question 10)
What is the main benefit of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) ?
==>
Speed, it makes your website faster by serving files from a location closer to the user.
